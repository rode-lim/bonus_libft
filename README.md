# bonus_libft
Okay, I finally convinced myself to do libft bonus as it helps me on my next projects to learn what are lists so come with me on this adventure.
Quick disclaimer I've decided to not even touch github of anyone else to make this project. So, theres a chance not everything will be the same as other people.

## GETTING STARTED WITH THE WORK!
### Personal step:
Okay, since I never worked with lsts before I set a markdown map using the VSCode extension
```
# Objective

## Learn about lists

### Whats a list?
### What is it used for?

## How to use?

### lst Header
### lst Makefile

## Functions

### ft_lstnew
### ft_lstadd_front
### ft_lstsize
### ft_lstlast
### ft_lstadd_back
### ft_lstdelone
### ft_lstclear

This extension is supper easy to use and this is the result:

### Personal Step 2:
Learn about lists...
#### So what's a list?
Lists in C are a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in a sequential order. It is implemented as a linked list data structure, where each element (node) contains a value and a pointer to the next element in the list. Lists are commonly used to store and manipulate data in a dynamic and efficient way.
